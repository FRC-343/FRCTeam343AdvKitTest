This file is an attempt to add more useability for in house teaching.
It is likly to not recive updates during a build season and will instead hopefully be replace by more and better comments.


This is team 343s Advantage kit test bed. As of the last test(Sometime in June 2024) on the current(2024 - Def Note) bot the drive was still unstable and no vision had been done.
343 wants to move to using Advantage kit as it allows better feedback for after match digestion, and provides a semi-stable simulated bot to run test code(Mainly autos that would be deemed as "scary"[Watch 2023 matches of 343 autos most of these were deemed "Scary"]).
